Challenge Problem: #1

The first challenge problem for p3 is to "Add an option to choose a random element(e.g. profile picture or shape for designs) to pass back through delegation." In my p3, I implemented a profile picture and the user of the app could click on the profile picture button, which will cause a view controller to be presented, and then they could choose a new profile picture from the presented view controller. In the presented view controller, once they have selected a new profile picture and they hit the save button, the profile picture in the main view controller will now change to reflect the new profile picture that they have chosen. I used delegation in order to achieve the changing of the profile picture in the main view controller from the presented view controller. This fits with extra credit #1's criteria of picking a random element to pass back through delegation.

Side Note:
For my data validation, the data validation that I have implemented is making sure that the Name field, Portfolio field, and the About field are not left empty. Since the Age slider already had a default value, I did not test if the age output was left empty or not. If the Name field, Portfolio field, or About field are left empty, the user will not be able to press the save button and an alert will pop up to tell the user that they need to fill out these fields before they can hit the save button.
